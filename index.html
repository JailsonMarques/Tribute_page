                  Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States,
                  serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Born on
                  February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Kentucky, he grew up in
                  poverty and received little formal education. Despite these
                  challenges, Lincoln went on to become one of the most
                  influential figures in American history. He led the country
                  through its Civil War, preserved the Union, and ended slavery.

                  Lincoln's political career began in 1834 when he was elected
                  to the Illinois state legislature. He later served one term in
                  Congress, but it was his election as president in 1860 that
                  would shape his legacy. His election prompted the secession of
                  seven southern states and the formation of the Confederacy.
                  Lincoln faced the daunting task of leading a divided nation at
                  a time when the country was on the brink of war. He declared
                  war on the Confederacy after they attacked Fort Sumter, and
                  the conflict lasted for four years. During his presidency,
                  Lincoln also delivered some of the most memorable speeches in
                  American history, including the Emancipation Proclamation and
                  the Gettysburg Address.
